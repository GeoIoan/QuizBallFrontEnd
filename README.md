# Quizball

Welcome to Quizball, a web application designed to offer an engaging quiz game with questions focused on football knowledge. This application represents a significant milestone for me, as it's the result of my unique idea(the idea of making it an app is mine, the game already exists in analog form), and I've developed it entirely from scratch. Your support and appreciation mean a lot to me, and I sincerely hope you find it enjoyable and engaging.

## Overview

Quizball allows two players or two teams to compete in a football-themed quiz game. The game is skillfully managed and presented by a Gamemaster who is responsible for creating teams and players. The core entities - teams, players, and the game itself - are stored in the database and are closely associated with the Gamemaster, ensuring a seamless gaming experience.

## Gameplay

- Players can choose pre-existing teams and players or create new ones for each game. Past game history is available for previously used teams or players.
- A random selection determines which team or player starts the game.
- Questions are divided into eight categories, each with a specific number of questions and different difficulty levels.
- The selection of questions and their points is based on category and difficulty.
- Custom games can be created by the Gamemaster by inputting 18 custom questions.

Thank you for exploring Quizball!
